In 2016 I took an introduction to computer science class, which included an HTML component. Though it looks amateurish in 2016, it was an interesting exercise in working with a limited tool set to achieve something that looks relatively polished by modern standards, and an introduction to a front-end language when I'd mostly experienced command-line applications up until that point.

What I learned is that creating a visually appealing application is mostly visual illusion and good design. The code is largely invisible and doesn't contribute much to the appearance of a page, even if it's managing the layout. I also learned about HTML's strange implementation and quirks when it comes to including any kind of logic aside from pointing and clicking. Lastly, I learned about how all the various containers work in relation to each other and how they're able to be used to separate code in HTML.

Though basic, my primary interest in computer science has always been web technology, so finally taking the time to learn HTML and how to make attractive HTML-only sites was exciting for me, from a design and educational progression standpoint, and I feel that having familiarized myself with HTML previously will prepare me for making better JavaScript web-apps in subsequent classes.
