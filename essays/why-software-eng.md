I'm old enough to (barely) remember a world without internet, and I remember my father being excited about a simple, fast search engine that didn't require extensive boolean logic to get relevant results on the first page--that company was Google. I grew up watching Google grow and transform, transforming the world with it. They say "software is eating the world," and it seems abstract, but I watched it happen, and how it made the world better. Ever since then, I've followed technology, and I've wanted to be a part of it, but always just on the other side, until now. I'm interested in software engineering because I hope to have that kind of positive impact one day.

While in school, I hope to learn the skills to build and deploy web-based applications that return time to people through automation. Our world is composed of data, and it's becoming so easy to measure everything, but all that information needs parsing and organizing to be useful, and the software industry is the only way to harness that power.

In time, I want to learn how to build web backend applications that can be used to serve actionable information to client applications on the web and in apps. To do so, I hope to learn how to becomne a full-stack developer that can deploy complete web solutions. Additionally, I want to learn about how to harness the Internet of Things and Big Data (including the machine learning and AI aspect) to continue improving the information used to power these services.
