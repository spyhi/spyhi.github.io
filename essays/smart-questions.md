I recently read ["How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) as part of my software engineering class, an essay that's now a classic in the open source and hacker community...so much that it warranted a "do not contact us" disclaimer punctuated with some florid insults for would-be inquirers. Despite all its hackery cred, I actually found myself thinking about how "smart questions" in the hacker world were really just smart questions, no matter the context--and I've seen first-hand the impact and importance of smart questions, even outside the software world.

Eric Raymond alludes to how a smart question leaves the respondent better for having answered it. In my experience, a sharp, insightful question has the potential to completely shift a team's view of a problem, revealing angles and approaches that couldn't have even been considered prior to uncovering that line of inquiry. However, smart questions do require some level of insight about the problem being asked about; superficial knowledge results in superficial questions, after all. Though smart questions are sometimes posed innocently, more often they are the result of deep familiarity with the problem.
