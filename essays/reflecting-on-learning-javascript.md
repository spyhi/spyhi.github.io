Before taking Software Engineering at UH Manoa in 2016, I had never coded in JavaScript even though I'd encountered it frequently in the wild due to its incredible popularity. My previous experience was mostly with Java, C, and C++ as part the the Manoa curriculum and JavaScript was a departure from that traditional machine-oriented, compiled structure. There is a definite adjustment period, but after going through CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp's resources, I think I understand why it's so popular.

A friend once described the language as "slapdash," and I definitely agree with that description. Coming fresh from a punishing language like C, I've found that JavaScript is extremely difficult to break. It has a very forgiving syntax (semicolons or no? Whatever) and it's also very forgiving in terms of how much thought has to be put into it before it is ever deployed, since nearly everything can be adjusted during runtime. The language's flexibility really creates a lot of opportunities for creative solutions, like how the multi-type arrays allow the programmer to return multiple variables at once, which creates one of the many workarounds for C++'s pass-by-reference structure.

I'm still learning about the language, but I do worry about the lack of rigoriousness. If a team isn't disciplined, JavaScript's flexibility can lead to hacky solutions that are difficult for project managers and collaborators to track. This problem could be exacerbated in open source projects. However, with its exploding popularity and large body of open source projects, I suspect those fears are probably overstated.

JavaScript's flexibility also makes Dr. Johnson's WODs a lot more fun than I thought they would be. I was initially skeptical of the high-pressure approach to coding, but as I've done a few, it's grown on me. While I don't think the solutions created are optimal, and I often think about more elegant solutions as I'm implementing my initial instinct, I like the challenge of thinking through a problem and implementing a solution as quickly as possible.

I'm very excited about getting deeper into JavaScript, though. The new paradigms offer a lot of potential for creative solutions I haven't been able to encounter in other languages. It'll be an exciting semester.
